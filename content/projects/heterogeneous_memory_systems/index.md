        To support data-intensive applications such as big data analytics, deep learning, and databases, continuous advances in high performance computing systems are required. In particular, data-intensive applications store more and more data in main memory, requiring a memory system that can continuously expand storage capacity and bandwidth. In this research, we explore heterogeneous memory systems that comprise Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and DRAM.

    research_topics: Architectural techniques for heterogeneous memory systems, System software (operating system) for heterogeneous memory systems
