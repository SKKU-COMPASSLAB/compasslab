        Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving very rapidly, and in some areas it outperforms human capabilities. This rapid advancement in artificial intelligence was possible because of significant improvements in the computing system performance. Therefore, for the continuous advances in artificial intelligence, continuous advances in high-performance computing technology are required to meet higher demand on the computing power in future AI applications. In this research, we explore novel architectural techniques and algorithm/software optimizations for CPU/GPU/FPGA to meet the computing requirements of the AI applications.
        
    research_topics: Memory systems for GPU (Deep learning Accelerators), CPU architectures for deep learning, Near-data processing for deep learning, Reliable DNN Accelerators, DNN model compression for on-device AI
