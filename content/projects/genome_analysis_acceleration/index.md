        Genome analysis is one of the key technologies that will drive future medical technologies. Recent advances in genomic data collection technology are expected to enable us to precisely diagnose genetic defects and other diseases caused by environmental factors such as cancer and diabetes using genome analysis technology. Practical use of genome analysis requires advances in analytical techniques that enable rapid analysis of collected data. The goal of this study is to develop a hardware accelerator that can accelerate genome sequence alignment and genome assembly which are key technologies for genome analysis. To do this, we will analyze the performance bottlenecks of the Genome Sequence Alignment and Genome Assembly algorithm and design a very new hardware accelerator to address them.
    
    research_topics: Hardware accelerator architectures and FPGA implementation, Near-data processing for accelerating genome sequence alignment
