        Operating Systems research explores the design and management of software that controls and coordinates hardware resources in a computing system. It focuses on optimizing core functions such as process management, memory management, file systems, and input/output control to ensure efficient and secure execution of applications. Key areas of study include scheduling algorithms for maximizing CPU utilization, memory allocation techniques to optimize performance, and methods for managing concurrent processes. Researchers also investigate new approaches for enhancing system security, scalability, and reliability, particularly in distributed and cloud environments. With the rise of multi-core processors and virtualization technologies, operating systems research plays a critical role in enabling efficient resource sharing and improving overall system performance.
