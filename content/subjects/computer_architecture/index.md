        Computer Architecture is a core research area that focuses on the design and optimization of computing systems, including processors, memory hierarchies, input/output devices, and their interconnections. It aims to enhance performance, power efficiency, and scalability to meet the demands of modern applications such as AI, big data, and cloud computing. Key topics include instruction set architecture, microarchitecture, pipelining, multi-core processors, and parallel processing. Researchers also explore innovations like heterogeneous computing, virtual memory system and cache management to optimize data flow and processing efficiency, shaping the future of high-performance computing systems.
